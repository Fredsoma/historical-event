# Hackstory: The Combahee River Collective

## Project Description (130 Words)

The Combahee River Collective, founded in 1974 by Black feminist activists, produced the influential 1977 “Combahee River Collective Statement,” articulating a vision for Black women’s liberation. Despite its profound impact on intersectional feminism, the Collective’s contributions remain underrecognized. This website immerses visitors in the Collective’s history, goals, and legacy through an interactive timeline, archival imagery, and multimedia excerpts. By amplifying the voices of founding members—Barbara Smith, Demita Frazier, Beverly Smith, and Audre Lorde—we honor their fight for freedom, self-determination, and collective care. Our design emphasizes accessibility and inclusive storytelling: high-contrast visuals, keyboard navigability, and descriptive alt text ensure everyone can engage. Through this digital experience, users will understand how the Combahee River Collective shaped modern intersections of race, gender, and sexuality, inspiring future generations to code the past and shape the future.

## Historical Focus

This site focuses on the Combahee River Collective (CRC), a Black feminist lesbian organization active from 1974 to 1980. The Collective’s 1977 Statement introduced the concept of identity politics, emphasizing how race, gender, class, and sexuality intersect. Although their work laid the foundation for modern intersectional movements, their legacy remains underrepresented in mainstream narratives. By highlighting the CRC’s origins, key figures, and enduring influence, our site spotlights a pivotal but often overlooked chapter in feminist history.
